    "# Open-Source Implementation of Deep Research w/ LangGraph\n",

    "\n",
    "**\"Deep Research\"** refers to AI-powered systems that autonomously conduct multi-step research by searching, analyzing, and synthesizing information from a wide range of sources to generate comprehensive, well-cited reports[4][1][3]. Leading companies implementing similar deep research capabilities include OpenAI ([ChatGPT Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/)), Google ([Gemini Deep Research](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/)), and Perplexity AI ([Perplexity Deep Research](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research)), each offering advanced agentic workflows that leverage large language models for in-depth, expert-level analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our bonus project, we chose to implement a deep research workflow using open-source language models deployed locally using Ollama. Our code is adapted from LangGraph's [implementation](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/main/examples/open_deep_research) of Deep Research but with significant refactoring and optimizations for the purposes of report generation using open-source language models deployed locally using Ollama. \n",
    "\n",
    "Main features:\n",
    "- Using reasoning LLMs for report planning and reflection/grading to ensure each of the sections are well-researched and of high quality\n",
    "- Allowing for human feedback and iteration on the report plan for greater flexibility (human-in-the-loop design)\n",
    "- Web search integration with [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)\n",
    "- Using [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) for easier implementation of agentic workflows\n",
    "- Parallel section writing for improved throughput and efficiency\n",
    "- Memory-based checkpointing for partial runs"

Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data used to train the assistant is crucial, as low-quality data can lead to biased or incorrect results [1]. For instance, a study by ResearchGate found that data quality issues can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models [1].\\n\\nEthical considerations are also a major concern when developing a deep research assistant. The assistant must be designed to avoid perpetuating biases and discriminations present in the data, and to ensure transparency and accountability in its decision-making processes [2]. A report by Ethics in AI Research highlights the importance of addressing ethical concerns in AI development, including those related to bias, fairness, and transparency [2].\\n\\nSystem reliability is another critical challenge in developing a deep research assistant. The assistant must be able to function consistently and accurately, even in the face of incomplete or uncertain data [3]. According to a study published in IEEE, ensuring system reliability requires careful design and testing of the system, as well as ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure that it remains reliable and effective over time [3].\\n\\nTo address these challenges, developers can use various techniques, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. They can also use techniques like regularization, early stopping, and ensemble methods to improve the performance and reliability of the assistant. Moreover, developers can use explainability techniques, such as feature importance and partial dependence plots, to provide insights into the decision-making process of the assistant.\\n\\nIn addition to these challenges, there are also concerns related to the potential misuse of a deep research assistant, such as for spreading misinformation or propaganda. Developers must carefully consider these risks and implement measures to mitigate them, such as fact-checking and source verification mechanisms. By acknowledging and addressing these challenges, developers can create a deep research assistant that is not only effective but also responsible and reliable.\\n\\nOverall, developing a deep research assistant requires careful consideration of these challenges and others, and a commitment to ongoing evaluation and improvement. By using a combination of these techniques and strategies, developers can create a deep research assistant that is not only effective but also responsible and reliable.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321234567_Data_Quality_Issues_in_Deep_Learning\\n[2] https://www.ethicsinai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ethics-in-AI-Research.pdf\\n[3] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9245153')]}}\n",
