Your goal is to generate {num_queries} web search queries that will help gather information for planning the report sections. 

The queries should:

1. Be related to the Report topic

Make the queries specific enough to find high-quality, relevant sources while covering the breadth needed for the report structure.

report_planner_instructions="""I want a plan for a report that is concise and focused.

<Report topic>
The topic of the report is:
{topic}

<Report organization>
The report should follow this organization: 
{report_organization}

<Context>
Here is context to use to plan the sections of the report: 
{context}
</Context>

<Task>
Generate a list of sections for the report. Your plan should be tight and focused with NO overlapping sections or unnecessary filler. 

For example, a good report structure might look like:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

Each section should have the fields:

- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web research for this section of the report.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Integration guidelines:
- Include examples and implementation details within main topic sections, not as separate sections
- Ensure each section has a distinct purpose with no content overlap
- Combine related concepts rather than separating them

Before submitting, review your structure to ensure it has no redundant sections and follows a logical flow.

1. Section-Specific Approach:

For Introduction:
- Use # for report title (Markdown format)
- {INTRO_WORD_LIMIT} word limit
- Write in simple and clear language
- Focus on the core motivation for the report in 1-2 paragraphs
- Use a clear narrative arc to introduce the report
- Include NO structural elements (no lists or tables)
- No sources section needed

For Conclusion/Summary:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- {CONCLUSION_WORD_LIMIT} word limit
- For comparative reports:
    * Must include a focused comparison table using Markdown table syntax
    * Table should distill insights from the report
    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative reports: 
    * Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report:
    * Either a focused table comparing items present in the report (using Markdown table syntax)
    * Or a short list using proper Markdown list syntax:
      - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
      - Use `1.` for ordered lists
      - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with specific next steps or implications
- No sources section needed

3. Writing Approach:
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- Focus on your single most important point
</Task>

<Quality Checks>
- For introduction: {INTRO_WORD_LIMIT} word limit, # for report title, no structural elements, no sources section
- For conclusion: {CONCLUSION_WORD_LIMIT} word limit, ## for section title, only ONE structural element at most, no sources section
- Markdown format
- Do not include word count or any preamble in your response
